# Greenland Transient Velocity Event Characterizer

## Package overview
Python package to identify and characterize transient acceleration events at North Lake in Southwest Greenland. This package is structured as follows:

- **`Data/`** Data from stations around North Lake.
- **`Analysis/`** Python scripts that take the data in Data/ as an input, and provide an analysis of transient acceleration events.
- **`Tests/`** Suite of tests to check that the Analysis script is working correctly.
- **`Results/`** Upon successful execution of the analysis pipeline, this directory will be generated, and analysis figures will be saved here.
