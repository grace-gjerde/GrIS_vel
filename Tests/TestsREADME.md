This directory contains functions to test the functions in the Tools directory. \
\
**test_linfit** \
The first test ensures that the slope is correct given test data. \
The second test ensures that the y-intercept is correct given test data. \
\
**test_max** \
Tests that the max function returns the maximum value of an array of numbers. \
Tests that the max function works for an array of zeros. \
Tests that the max functions works for an array including negative numbers. \
Tests that the max function works with the real data and ensures that the max value is a float. \
\
**test_mean** \
Tests that the mean function returns the mean value of an array of numbers. \
Tests that the mean function ignores NaNs. \
\
**test_min** \
Tests that the min function returns the minimumvalue of an array of numbers.
\
Tests that the min function works for an array of zeros.\
Tests that the min functions works for an array including negative numbers.\
Tests that the min function ignores NaNs.\
\
**test_moving_mean** \
In the case that there is one day, tests that there is one datapoint. \
In the case that there is constant data, tests that the mean is equal to the constant value.
